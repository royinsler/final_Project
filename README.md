# Final Project
My Graduation project for my M.Sc. in Data science @HIT

Breast cancer Background
-Second most common malignancy in women worldwide
-One of eight women will be diagnosed in their lifetime
-Early diagnosis critical for reducing mortality
Current Screening Methods:
1. Full Field Digital Mammography (FFDM)
2. Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT)
3. Breast MRI for high-risk cases


Projectâ€™s Objectives
- Enhance performance by using additional deep learning architectures on DBT images.
- By synthetically enriching the dataset, the goal is to increase both specificity and sensitivity.

The first phase of the project consists of preprocessing of the data. In the second phase, we've applied a few transformer architucures on the DBT dataset(with two different resolutions) to enhance today's best classification results. On the third phase, we've enriched the DB with images of a minority kind (dense breasts and calicifications, which the model tend to miss more than any other kind) using GenAI, then, re-running our models once again.
