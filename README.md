# final_Project
My Graduation project for my M.Sc. in Data science @HIT

Projectâ€™s Objectives
- Enhance performance by using additional deep learning architectures on DBT images.
- By synthetically enriching the dataset, the goal is to increase both specificity and sensitivity.

In the first phase of the project, we're exploring a few transformer architucures on the DBT dataset and on the second phase we're trying to enrich the DB with more images using GenAI.
